Why JWT is Stateless
1️⃣ No session stored on the server
With normal login (session-based auth):
User logs in
Server creates a session and stores user data in memory or Redis
Client receives a JSESSIONID
On every request, server checks its session store
➡️ Server must keep session state

With JWT
User logs in
Server creates a JWT containing user data (claims)
JWT is signed with a private key
Client stores the JWT locally (localStorage/cookies)
On each request, client sends:
Server does not look into any session store
It only:
Verifies the signature
Reads claims (username, roles, expiry)
